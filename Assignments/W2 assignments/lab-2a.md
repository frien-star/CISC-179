# My first Python Code
```python 
# 1a.
print("All the world's a stage,")
print("And all the men and women merely players:")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one mand in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages")
print("\n")

# 1b.
print("All the world's a stage," + '\n' + "And all the men and women merely players:" +
                                   "\n" + "They have their exits and their entrances;" +
                                   "\n" + "And one man in his time plays many parts," +
                                   "\n" + "His acts being seven ages.")

# 1c. The following output without coding would be: 127.0.0.1

'''1d. You can use flush=true to cut down on time and immediately output to console.

''' 1e. I am rather confused how to answer this.
        I am not sure what is specifically meant by- "Which argument triggers the flush?"
        Because if print() behaves like flush=true, then isn't print(string + flush=true)?'''
